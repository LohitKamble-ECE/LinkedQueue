# Implementing a Queue with a Singly Linked List

## The Queue

A queue is a collection of objects that are inserted and removed according to
the **first-in**, **first-out** (**FIFO**) principle. That is, elements can be
inserted at any time, but only the element that has been in the queue the
longest can be next removed.

## The Singly Linked List

A singly linked list, in its simplest form, is a collection of nodes that
collectively form a linear sequence. Each node stores a reference to an object
that is an element of the sequence, as well as a reference to the next node of
the sequence.
